# 🌟 NSSC Hackathon Project: Cosmic Collision-Analysing Asteroid Risks with Data

## 📝 Problem Statement
During the prestigious NSSC Hackathon, we tackled a problem centered around **[describe the challenge briefly, e.g., predictive modeling, classification, etc.]**. The objective was to design a machine learning solution capable of [specific objective, e.g., accurately classifying, predicting, or analyzing data], utilizing a real-world dataset provided during the competition.

The dataset contained [details about the dataset, e.g., number of records, features, target variable]. Our goal was to not only build an accurate model but also ensure it was interpretable, efficient, and deployable.

## 💡 Solution Overview
To address the problem effectively, we employed the **Random Forest Algorithm**, a powerful ensemble learning method known for:
- Handling large datasets with higher dimensionality.
- Mitigating overfitting through bagging and random feature selection.
- Offering feature importance insights for better interpretability.

### **Approach Breakdown**
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Analyzed the dataset to identify trends, missing values, and potential outliers.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data by:
     - Handling missing values appropriately.
     - Encoding categorical variables.
     - Normalizing or standardizing numerical features as needed.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Leveraged Random Forest’s inbuilt feature importance mechanism to identify critical features.
   - Reduced redundant or irrelevant features to enhance model performance.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier` (or `RandomForestRegressor`) from Scikit-learn.
   - Tuned hyperparameters such as:
     - Number of trees (`n_estimators`).
     - Maximum depth of trees (`max_depth`).
     - Minimum samples split (`min_samples_split`).
   - Applied cross-validation to validate the model's robustness.

4. **Evaluation and Insights**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like:
     - Classification tasks: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
     - Regression tasks: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
   - Visualized feature importance and other insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Packaged the solution for deployment using [e.g., Flask, Streamlit, or a simple script-based interface].
   - Designed a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction with the model.
